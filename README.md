# Stonks
Students often have keen interests in financial literacy but lack the funds to have real world experience. Stonks lets students have a gamified (competitive) yet safe space to learn how the stock market functions by trading while competing against other students. 
While similar projects exist, our solution is highly user-friendly with a focus on modern design and quick actions.

## Built With
1. Flask (backend)
2. Firebase (database)
3. Finnhub as Public Stock API (data)
4. Bootstrap and Jinja templates (frontend)


## Setup
1. Acquire project permissions
2. Clone the project onto your computer
3. Download necessary tools
    1. Python 3.11
    2. IDE of choice (Ex. Visual Studio Code)
    3. Set up virtual environment (isolates project python and libraries)
        1. Easy with VSCode, just install Python extension and create a new virtual environment from the command palette.
            1. Choose the correct Python version, select requirements.txt to import all necessary libraries, and you're set.
        2. Alternatively install requirements globally or isolated manually (not recommended unless you know what you're doing)
4. To start up the project, launch virtual environment (default after setup in VSCode) and run ```python3 server.py ```
